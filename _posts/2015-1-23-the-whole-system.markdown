						<p>Several months after the Form 1+ launch, the main launch video was still the only new video released by the Formlabs company… and it was beginning to make the company's home page a little stale.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="right-column column">
						<p>And so, during my last month as a full-time employee at Formlabs, I was given a challenge. Create a new main video from concept to final product in 30 days on a minuscule budget. Challenge accepted.</p>

					<h4>The Concept</h4>
					<div class="left-column column">
						<p>Most people think the only thing Formlabs makes is a 3d printer. However, in reality the company has created an entire ecosystem that is devised to work seamlessly together. From the printer to the software to the resin and the finish kit, this system allows the company to control how their customers experience the 3d printing process from beginning to end.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="right-column column">
						<p>This video singles out each aspect of this printing ecosystem and shines a spotlight on the benefits of each… Literally. We follow a young man through the printing process, using lights above each individual product to pull it into focus and out of the darkness. With every product, we get up close and personal, sensing how each element contributes to the overall success of the user experience.</p>

					<h4>The Shoot</h4>
					<div class="left-column column">
						<p>Spread over two long evenings, we shot this video in the active Formlabs office. On both evenings every single desk was stripped of people’s normal desk possessions and dressed to look like a minimalist, clean office. And both nights each desk had to return to its original state for people to work at the next morning. Kind of a nightmare when you think about the amount of effort that involves.</p><p>
						The first night was spent filming all the wide angles and the slow fade between spotlights. The second night was reserved for medium and closeups of each product. Most takes alternated between locked down, movement on a slider and/or some sort of pan/tilt. Pretty standard stuff.
					</p>
					</div>
					<div class="right-column column">
						<p>Lighting was arguably the most important aspect of this shoot. To make the spotlights really pop, the general atmosphere in the office had to be quite dark. To achieve a stylized backdrop for this video while remaining on a budget, the walls were lined with cheap clamp work lights directed up the wall. The lighting of the main desk in front was designed by Jon Gonda and was made to be highly flexible.</p><p>
						Four par can lights above the desk individually lit the products from above giving the spot light look. Add in a couple back lights, some fill lights up front and soon we had something that looked pretty damn good. All the lights were individually dimmable allowing complete control.
